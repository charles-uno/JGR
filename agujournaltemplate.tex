\begin{abstract}
Field line resonances (FLRs) in the Pc4 range (\SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}) serve to energize magnetospheric particles through drift-resonant interactions, carry energy from high to low altitude, induce currents in the magnetosphere, and scatter particles into the atmosphere. Wave structure and polarization significantly impact these behaviors. The present work showcases a new two and a half dimensional code, Tuna, ideally suited to model FLRs, with the ability to consider a broad range of azimuthal modenumbers, coupling between the poloidal, toroidal, and compressional modes, and arbitrary harmonic structure. Using Tuna, the interplay between Joule dissipation and poloidal-to-toroidal rotation is considered for Pc4 pulsations under both dayside and nightside conditions. An effort is also made to incorporate giant pulsations, a subclass of Pc4 noted for its distinctive ground signatures, into the broader Pc4 morphology. Numerical results are supplemented by a survey of 762 Pc4 pulsations using data from the Van Allen Probes, the first such survey to characterize each event by both polarization and harmonic. The combination of numerical and observational results suggests an explanation for the disparate distributions observed in poloidal and toroidal Pc4 events.

% The main text should start with an introduction. Except for short
% manuscripts (such as comments and replies), the text should be divided
% into sections, each with its own heading.

% Headings should be sentence fragments and do not begin with a

%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% Single-line equations are centered.
% Equation arrays will appear left-aligned.

Math coded inside display math mode \[ ...\]
 will not be numbered, e.g.,:
 \[ x^2=y^2 + z^2\]

 Math coded inside \begin{equation} and \end{equation} will
 be automatically numbered, e.g.,:
 \begin{equation}
 x^2=y^2 + z^2
 \end{equation}


% To create multiline equations, use the
% \begin{eqnarray} and \end{eqnarray} environment
% as demonstrated below.
\begin{eqnarray}
  x_{1} & = & (x - x_{0}) \cos \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \sin \Theta  \nonumber \\
  y_{1} & = & -(x - x_{0}) \sin \Theta \nonumber \\
        && + (y - y_{0}) \cos \Theta.
\end{eqnarray}

%If you don't want an equation number, use the star form:
%\begin{eqnarray*}...\end{eqnarray*}

% Break each line at a sign of operation
% (+, -, etc.) if possible, with the sign of operation
% on the new line.

% Indent second and subsequent lines to align with
% the first character following the equal sign on the
% first line.

% Use an \hspace{} command to insert horizontal space
% into your equation if necessary. Place an appropriate
% unit of measure between the curly braces, e.g.
% \hspace{1in}; you may have to experiment to achieve
% the correct amount of space.

%
%  EQUATION NUMBERING: COUNTER
%
%% ------------------------------------------------------------------------ %%

% You may change equation numbering by resetting
% the equation counter or by explicitly numbering
% an equation.

% To explicitly number an equation, type \eqnum{}
% (with the desired number between the brackets)
% after the \begin{equation} or \begin{eqnarray}
% command.  The \eqnum{} command will affect only
% the equation it appears with; LaTeX will number
% any equations appearing later in the manuscript
% according to the equation counter.
%

% If you have a multiline equation that needs only
% one equation number, use a \nonumber command in
% front of the double backslashes (\\) as shown in
% the multiline equation above.

% If you are using line numbers, remember to surround
% equations with \begin{linenomath*}...\end{linenomath*}

%  To add line numbers to lines in equations:
%  \begin{linenomath*}
%  \begin{equation}
%  \end{equation}
%  \end{linenomath*}
