< Resonant oscillations in the Pc4 range (\SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}) serve to energize magnetospheric particles through drift-resonant interactions, carry energy from high to low altitude, induce currents in the magnetosphere, and scatter particles into the atmosphere. Wave structure and polarization significantly impact these behaviors. The present work showcases a new two and a half dimensional code, Tuna, ideally suited to model such waves, with the ability to consider a broad range of azimuthal modenumbers, coupling between the poloidal, toroidal, and compressional modes, and arbitrary harmonic structure. Using Tuna, the interplay between Joule dissipation and poloidal-to-toroidal conversion is considered for Pc4 pulsations under both dayside and nightside conditions. An effort is also made to incorporate giant pulsations, a subclass of Pc4 noted for its distinctive ground signatures, into the broader Pc4 morphology.

< Pc4 pulsations are magnetic pulsations with periods of a minute or two (\SIrange{7}{25}{\mHz}), corresponding to field line resonances (FLRs) at $4 \lesssim L \lesssim 7$\citep[and references therein]{anderson_1990}.

< Harmonic number is a measure of FLR wavelength along the geomagnetic field line. First-harmonic FLRs are associated with drift resonance, while the second harmonic is associated with drift-bounce resonance\citep{dai_2013,poulter_1983}. In the limit of high conductivity, the wavelength of a second-harmonic FLR is equal to the length of its magnetic field line; it exhibits two nodes (antinodes) in the magnetic (electric) perturbation, with magnentic antinodes (electric nodes) at the northern and southern foot points and at the equator. A first-harmonic (also called fundamental-mode) FLR has a wavelength twice that long, with a single magnetic (electric) node (antinode) at the equator, and magnetic antinodes (electric nodes) only at the foot points. Harmonic can in principle be determined from a wave's frequency; however, disagreements can arise due to uncertainty in the Alfv\'en speed profile along flux tubes\citep{takahashi_2013}. Unambiguous classification of an event's harmonic requires two measurements, which can be achieved in several different ways: ground-based measurements can be taken at conjugate field line foot points, a ground measurement can be complimented by a simultaneous in situ measurement, or a single spacecraft can collect both electric and magnetic field data\citep{dai_2015}. The third approach has only recently become possible, via the THEMIS\citep{angelopoulos_2008} and Van Allen Probes\citep{stratton_2012} missions.

< Azimuthal modenumber corresponds to wave structure around Earth's equator. One wavelength of a wave with modenumber $m$ spans $\frac{24}{m}$ hours in MLT. Waves with small azimuthal modenumber ($m \lesssim 10$) are typically driven by broadband solar wind conditions\citep{degeling_2014,hao_2014,zong_2009,chen_1974,liu_2011,southwood_1974}, and are compressional in the radial direction; that is, the radial and parallel magnetic perturbations are coupled, allowing propagation across $L$-shells. On the other hand, FLRs with large azimuthal modenumber originate within the magnetosphere via resonant interactions with trapped particles. Large-$m$ waves are compressional in the azimuthal direction, but not the radial direction. Propagation of large-$m$ waves across field lines is evanescent\citep{cummings_1969,radoski_1974}, since the cutoff frequency scales with $m$, as discussed by \citet{lee_1990}. Large-$m$ waves are less likely to be observed by ground magnetometers due to attenuation by the atmosphere\citep{hughes_1976,wright_1999,yeoman_2001}.

< Numerical modeling of the magnetosphere is traditionally carried out via global MHD models such as LFM\citep{lyon_2004,merkin_2010}. These global models focus on coupling between the solar wind and the magnetosphere. However, as noted by \citet{claudepierre_2009,claudepierre_2010}, wave frequencies higher than about \SI{20}{\mHz} are attenuated due to the limited spatial resolution. Furthermore, global models are obligated to impose severe simplifying assumptions at the earthward boundary, for example imposing an electrostatic ionosphere at $3 R_E$ (rather than about $R_E + \SI{100}{\km}$), and applying a ``Boris correction'' to artificially slow propagation in regions of high Alfv\'en speed\citep{raeder_2001,lyon_2004,merkin_2010}.
< 
< These simplifications are necessary because of the Courant condition: the simulation time step must be sufficiently small that no signal can travel across more than one cell per time step. The Alfve\'n speed can approach the speed of light in the auroral acceleration region; to resolve phenomena at a \SI{100}{\km} scale, the simulation time step would need to be on the order of \SI{e-4}{\s} -- a prohibitive computational expense. As a result, global MHD models are not typically used to examine auroral, ionospheric, and low-orbit phenomena\citep{luhr_2016}, in particular ULF waves with frequencies near or above \SI{20}{\mHz}.
< 
< A number of researchers (for example, \citet{mallinckrodt_1978,goertz_1979,streltsov_2003,lee_1989,song_2006,lysak_2004,woodroffe_2012,waters_2013,mceachern_2016}) have developed
< 
< models which focus specifically on magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling. These models exhibit much sharper resolution at the ionosphere, with earthward boundaries as low as \SI{100}{\km}, as well as much shorter time steps due to the high Alfve\'n speed. This allows them to faithfully resolve MHD waves, including ULF waves, in the auroral zone. Notably, because of the Courant condition, the high resolution and small time step incur a large computational cost. Whereas global models describe long-term evolution of the solar wind and magnetosphere, auroral models typically cover just a few minutes of transient wave behavior.

< Tuna models a (two-dimensional) meridional slice of the magnetosphere, but evaluates Maxwell's equations in all three dimensions. Colloquially, Tuna can be said to have two and a half (``tuna half'') dimensions. The two-dimensional grid allows Tuna to consider a realistic ionosphere, which is prohibitively expensive for a true three-dimensional code. The three-dimensional derivatives allow Tuna to capture wave behavior in the azimuthal direction, which is invisible to traditional two-dimensional models.
< 
< There is no grid spacing in the azimuthal direction, so azimuthal derivatives are evaluated by taking all fields to vary as $\exp \left(i m \phi\right)$ for fixed azimuthal modenumber $m$. In Maxwell's equations, $\frac{\partial}{\partial \phi}$ is simply replaced by $i m$. Fields are complex-valued as a result, with the imaginary component corresponding to a phase shift in the azimuthal direction compared to the real component.
< 
< The assumption of a fixed $\exp \left(i m \phi\right)$ neglects the potentially-significant differences between the dayside and nightside magnetospheres. However, those differences are of little concern when modeling Pc4 pulsations, since they are typically localized in MLT\citep{anderson_1990,dai_2015,engebretson_1992,liu_2009}. Instead, different regions are modeled using different profiles for the dielectric tensor and conductivity tensor.

In particular, \cref{fig_energy} allows a comparison of energy accumulation on the dayside and on the nightside in response to the same energy input. On the dayside, where conductivity is high, the toroidal mode grows in magnitude over the course of many drive periods.

Any event within \SI{3}{\degree} of the magnetic equator is also not used. In order to distinguish an odd mode from an even mode\footnote{
> The techniques used in the present work do not make an explicit distinction between first (second) harmonics and higher odd (even) harmonics. That said, higher harmonics are comparably rare in the inner magnetosphere, so it is reasonable to assume that odd events are mostly first harmonics and even events are mostly second harmonics.}, it's necessary to know whether the observation is made north or south of the equator.

< Roughly speaking, event distributions (shown in \cref{fig_all,fig_mode}) are found to be consistent with past surveys. Toroidal events dominate overall, and are primarily seen on the morning side. Poloidal events are spread broadly in MLT with a peak near noon and distinctive odd harmonics in the early morning. From there, the simultaneous consideration of harmonic and polarization, combined with the numerical results above, offers significant insight.

< The spatial distribution of even poloidal events looks much like the spatial distribution of even toroidal events; both distributions peak near noon, and both prefer the evening side to the morning side. The primary difference between them is that the toroidal events are more sharply peaked near noon, while the poloidal events spread more broadly across the afternoon and evening. Similarly, odd poloidal and odd toroidal events exhibit similar distributions with the toroidal distribution skewed slightly dayward. This is consistent (per the above numerical results) with poloidal events as an effective source for (same-parity) toroidal events on the dayside, and a less-effective source on the nightside.

This (consistent with the numerical results) suggests that the distinctive properties attributed to giant pulsations are in fact shared by odd poloidal Pc4 waves overall.

< The present work discusses the development of Tuna, a numerical model created with Pc4 waves in mind. Using Tuna, Pc4 waves are modeled across varying frequencies, azimuthal modenumbers, and ionospheric conductivity profiles, suggesting novel connections between several properties. Numerical results are complemented by a survey of Pc4 events measured by the Van Allen Probes; 762 half-hour Pc4 events are identified using data from the EMFISIS and EFW instruments, and each event is classified by polarizarion and harmonic.

< Numerical work suggests that poloidal Pc4 waves convert to the toroidal mode on timescales comparable to the oscillation period, suggesting poloidal waves as a significant source for toroidal waves. Mode conversion is most effective on the dayside, where conductivity is higher; on the nightside, the dissipation timescale is comparable to the oscillation period, so much poloidal energy is lost before converting to the toroidal mode.

As a result, poloidal events overall exhibit a significantly different spatial distribution compared to toroidal events overall.
